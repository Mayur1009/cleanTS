Description: Package for automating univariate time series cleaning. It
    implements reliable and efficient procedures for automating the
    process of cleaning univariate time series data. The package provides
    integration with already developed and deployed tools for missing
    value imputation and outlier detection. It also provides a way of
    visualizing large time-series data in different resolutions.
